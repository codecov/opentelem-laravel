# laravel-codecov-opentelemetry

_Note: This is a work in progress project and is currently not recommended for use by anyone._

## Purpose

This library aims to make interfacing with Codecov's open telemetry based projects more straightforward for Laravel based applications. It is currently pre-alpha and not recommended for use.

This package is not intended to be a general integration library for open telemetry, zipkin, etc. If you're looking for a more general opentelemetry integration package for Laravel, we currently recommended the package that inspired this one by GitHub user SeanHood, found here: https://github.com/SeanHood/laravel-opentelemetry
